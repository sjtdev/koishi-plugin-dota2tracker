# Internationalization

The plugin supports two languages: `zh-CN` and `en-US`,  
with the priority of `channel language > platform language`.

If you need to switch languages,

- For channel language settings, please refer to the official documentation [koishi-internationalization](https://koishi.chat/en-US/manual/usage/customize.html#internationalization).
- To use a common platform language, set the language priority in the `global settings`.

# Custom Text

Based on `koishi`, most content in this plugin can be customized for multiple languages, such as `hero aliases`, `position nicknames`, and `reporting comments`, and more.

Note that some special format strings need to be set according to the format:
- Hero alias and broadcast info format: `"", ""`
- Title system format: `Title-Color` (Color is in HEX format, with `#` prefix)

If an error occurs after setting, please restore the default state (i.e., remove custom text) and set it again strictly according to the format.
