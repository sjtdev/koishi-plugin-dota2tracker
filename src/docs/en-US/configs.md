# Configuration Instructions
### Basic Settings
#### STRATZ_API_TOKEN `string`
- The plugin relies on Stratz's API for data retrieval, so this must be configured to use it.
- A Stratz API token can be easily obtained by logging in with a Steam account. It allows 10,000 calls per day, which is generally sufficient.
> [!TIP] Daily API Call Calculation: 1440Ã—(P/5)+(1+W)+R
> = minutes in a day Ã— (number of bound and subscribed users Ã· 5) rounded up  
>  \+ (one parse request + requests sent for parsing when waiting for reports)  
>  \+ command query call count


#### dataParsingTimeoutMinutes `number`
- Data parsing timeout (in minutes)
- While player logins during games will automatically trigger parsing, and the plugin sends a parse request when tracking match data, issues like Stratz outages, game version updates not followed by Stratz, and non-standard modes could delay or prevent parsing. 
- After the match ends, if the wait time exceeds this configured value, incomplete match reports will be published.

#### proxyAddress `string`
- Proxy address. Leave blank to disable the proxy.

### Message Settings

#### urlInMessageType `checkbox`
- Include links in messages
- Include corresponding Stratz match page links in `dota2tracker.query-match/query-recent-match` commands and `push match messages`.

#### maxSendItemCount `number`
- Maximum number of item images to send via `query-item` command. Results exceeding this limit will not generate item images.

#### showItemListAtTooMuchItems `boolean`
- Whether to send item list image when query results exceed *maxSendItemCount* limit or when no search parameters are provided.

#### customItemAlias `array`

#### templateFonts `string[]`
Font names used in the template. Requires font files installed on the koishi host machine.  
Multiple fonts can be added; the system will use the first available font from top to bottom.  
If all fonts are unavailable, falls back to system defaults.  
Important formatting rules:  
- Enclose font names in quotes (" ") if they contain spaces or special characters (recommended for all font names)
- Do NOT enclose generic font family names (e.g. sans-serif, monospace) in quotes
Examples:
```
"Microsoft YaHei"
sans-serif
```
