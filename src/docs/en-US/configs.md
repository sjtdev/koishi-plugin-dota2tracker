# Configuration Instructions
### Basic Settings
#### STRATZ_API_TOKEN `string`
- The plugin relies on Stratz's API for data retrieval, so this must be configured to use it.
- A Stratz API token can be easily obtained by logging in with a Steam account. It allows 10,000 calls per day, which is generally sufficient.
> [!TIP] Daily API Call Calculation: 1440Ã—(P/5)+(1+W)+R
> = minutes in a day Ã— (number of bound and subscribed users Ã· 5) rounded up  
>  \+ (one parse request + requests sent for parsing when waiting for reports)  
>  \+ command query call count

> [!WARNING] About stratz API Forbidden 403
> See [API 403](./api-403.md)

#### dataParsingTimeoutMinutes `number`
- Data parsing timeout (in minutes)
- While player logins during games will automatically trigger parsing, and the plugin sends a parse request when tracking match data, issues like Stratz outages, game version updates not followed by Stratz, and non-standard modes could delay or prevent parsing. 
- After the match ends, if the wait time exceeds this configured value, incomplete match reports will be published.

#### proxyAddress `string`
- Proxy address. Leave blank to disable the proxy.

#### suppressStratzNetworkErrors `boolean`
> Due to the instability of the Stratz server and varying network conditions, a large number of network errors (e.g., timeouts) can occur during data polling. This option is available to suppress these errors and prevent them from flooding your logs.
- When enabled, Stratz-related network errors will be logged at the `debug` level instead of the `error` level.
> [!TIP] How to Display Debug Logs in Koishi
> By default, Koishi does not display `debug` level logs. To view them, you need to add the following configuration to the bottom of your `koishi.yml` file via the **Koishi Web UI** (`File Explorer > koishi.yml`) and then restart Koishi.
> ```yaml
> logger:
>   levels:
>     dota2tracker.stratz-api: 3
>     dota2tracker.match-watcher: 3
>     dota2tracker.parse-polling: 3
>     dota2tracker.match: 3
>     dota2tracker.player: 3
> ```

#### templateFonts `string[]`
Font names used in the template. Requires font files installed on the koishi host machine.  
Multiple fonts can be added; the system will use the first available font from top to bottom.

Important formatting rules:  
- Enclose font names in quotes (" ") if they contain spaces or special characters (recommended for all font names)

Examples:
```
"Microsoft YaHei"
sans-serif
```
