# Handling API `403 Forbidden` Errors
If the plugin encounters a `403 Forbidden` error while fetching data, it typically means your access to the Stratz API has been **temporarily restricted** for violating its security policies.

##### Possible Causes
Recently, Stratz has tightened its API access policies to ensure fair use and service stability. A `403` error is usually triggered by one of the following scenarios:

1. **Multiple IPs, Single Token**: The same API Token was used to send requests from multiple different IP addresses in a short period.

2. **Single IP, Multiple Tokens**: The same IP address was used to send requests with multiple different API Tokens in a short period.

This often occurs if you have configured the dota2tracker plugin or other Stratz-powered tools on multiple devices (e.g., home computer, work computer, server).

##### Solutions
You can choose one of the following solutions to resolve the restriction:

* **Solution 1: Wait**

  * Stop all applications that use your Stratz API token (including this plugin) and wait for the restriction to be lifted automatically.

  * Based on **current** testing, the ban duration is typically 1 hour. Please note that this policy may change in the future.

* **Solution 2: Refresh Your Token**

  * This method can lift the restriction immediately, but you must update the old token with the new one everywhere it is used.

  1. Go to the Stratz website and **log out** of your account.

  2. **Log back in** using your Steam account.

  3. Visit the [Stratz API Page](https://stratz.com/api) to get your new token.

  4. Replace the old token with the new one in the Koishi plugin configuration.
