### match_2

<ImageViewer src="/en-US/generated/match_2.png" />

A MAX+ style template, sourced from [Steam_watcher](https://github.com/SonodaHanami/Steam_watcher).  
Compared to `match_1`, it lacks some details like: laning outcome, permanent buffs at game end, support item purchase counts, etc. However, it offers better readability and aligns more with DOTA2 players' data browsing habits.

### match_2+

Supplement to `match_2`, adding some additional information, such as the situation and economic line charts, and the results of the lines.
